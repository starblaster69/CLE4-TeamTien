# CLE4-TeamTien LetterRace

welcome to the repository for our 4th semester college project, making our very own videogame, to help third graders learn to read in a fun manner. after doing a few weeks of target audience research, we settled on making a 3d racing game, where your car goes faster (or you get points, at its current stage), when you pick up the right letter-collectable to correctly spell a given word.

this is a dutch course, for dutch third-graders, so our game is entirely in dutch. regardless of this, non dutch speakers can still easily try it out and get a feel for it in our currently latest build, made during the projects original timeframe, [Here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/letter-race).

two out of three team members have explicitly stated on wanting to continue working on this game in the future, so expect sporadic updates.
