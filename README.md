# CLE4-TeamTien LetterRace

welcome to the repository for our 4th semester college project, making our very own videogame, to help third graders learn to read in a fun manner. after doing a few weeks of target audience research, we settled on making a 3d racing game, where your car goes faster (or you get points, at its current stage), when you pick up the right letter-collectable to correctly spell a given word.

this is a dutch course, for dutch third-graders, so our game is entirely in dutch. regardless of this, non dutch speakers can still easily try it out and get a feel for it in our currently latest build, made during the projects original timeframe, [Here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/letter-race).

two out of three team members have explicitly stated on wanting to continue working on this game in the future, so expect sporadic updates.

to download our files, just paste all of these into your unity project folder, extract the quantum tek sprites.RAR (for some reason this was the only way it'd let me upload that one). and then unity should recognize it, and allow you to open it.

Unity DOES have a built-in collaboration repository function, and supposed automatic github functionality, but we could not get the latter to work, and so all these files were manually uploaded. in the case of an error, shoot me a message and i'll see what i can do!
